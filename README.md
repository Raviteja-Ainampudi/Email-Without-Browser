# Email-Without-Browser
To send an email to user without using a browser at the host machine.

The basic intention of this script is to send an email to a user without using a browser on host machine.

As the reputed email providers like Gmail and Yahoo have blocked the external access of SMTP servers without a browser.
In order to access the SMTP server of both Gmail and Yahoomail. We need to turn ON the "ACCESS FOR LESS SECURE APPS"
Send email from GMAIL and Yahoomail without a browser.

In Gmail - To Turn ON - Access for less secure apps - use this - https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
In Yahoomail - To Turn ON - Access for less secure apps - use this - https://login.yahoo.com/account/security?
You can revoke the changes once done using this python script
